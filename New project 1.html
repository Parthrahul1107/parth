India ranks 122nd of 138 nations on gender equality. 
In some rural areas, more than fifty percent of girls are married before age fifteen. 
Female literacy is still considerably lower than male literacy. However, 
women make the best poverty fighters. Women use their earnings not only to feed their families,
 but to improve their families’ quality of life as well as fund their children’s education, 
giving the next generation a much better chance to live out of poverty.
